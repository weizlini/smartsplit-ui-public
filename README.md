# SmartSplit Web Client
This client will be the synthesis of the other react based front-end react projects. It will integrate all the necessary features for the MVP

## Installation
this is a typical create-react-app. Clone the repo, do an  `npm install` and then `npm start` to run it locally

## Deployment
Easy peasy: just do an `npm build` and deploy the contents of the `/build` folder.

Note that the API base url is stored in 
`/src/api/config.js` you must change it before doing a build. the current API is not available it would be worthwhile to create a mock for it for testing

## Testing
no testing has been created
